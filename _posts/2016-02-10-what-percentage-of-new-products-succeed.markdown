title: What Percentage of New Products succeed
layout: post

Important because planning process in matgyure companies for mature products are that everyone that passes a business case is a success.
Success being adding incremental revenue.

Good approach for incremental feature for existing / mature products.
Main threats being that costs are too high to build.
because, 
- Small margins
revenue model and market werll understood

However not a good model for trying to find new products.
Doesnt recognise the fundamental different nature of cost.
Doesnt recognise the goal is not break even, but find products with big margins/revenue.

So if a mature company wants to take the right approach they need to recognise the model.
That most projects will fail to deliver large incremental revenue.
Some will deliver a lot,
It is important to have a model which exploits this.

% of Features that are commonly used in mature product = 20%

Fred Wilson (hypothetical) example
(http://avc.com/2016/02/fund-level-vs-deal-by-deal-carry/)
30% success (Deliver 5x revenue)
35% ok, break even
35% loss.
