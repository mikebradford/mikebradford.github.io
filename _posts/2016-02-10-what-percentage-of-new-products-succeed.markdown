title: What Percentage of New Products succeed
layout: post
---
Why this question is important to me is because of my ongoing quest to change the mindset of mature companies adopting Agile.

Legacy business processes in mature companies undermine or conflict with Agile. This dichotomy is one reason why _Agile_ can fail to deliver _agile_ benefits.

In this case the conflict is because of the different risk profiles for mature and new products, and the different investment strategies required. 

The planning process in mature companies for mature products is based on the belief that passing the business case process is an accurate predictor of success. Additionally that success is defined by adding incremental revenue to either protect, or slightly increase margin or market share.

This is a good approach for incremental features for existing / mature products because the main risk is that high costs will eat up any incremental revenue delivered.

This risk is most likely because of the small margins involved in the product, and the revenue model is pretty accurate as the market, product fit and value proposition are well understood

__However__ this is not a good model for trying to find new products since it
1. Doesn't recognise the fundamental different nature of risk / cost.
2. Doesn't recognise the goal is not break even, but find products with big margins/revenue.

For new products the main risk, and so cost, is that the product won't find market fit. Essentially this means that revenue predictions tend to be wildly wrong. 
Additionally the goal is not to break even, but to discover a product/market with significant margin / ROI.

So if a mature company wants to take the right approach they need to recognise the fundamentally different business model that
1. Most projects will fail to deliver large incremental revenue.
2. Some will deliver a lot,
It is important to have a model which exploits this, not by predominantly tracking cost against forecast, but tracking against market fit.

It is easier to show this difference by considering some statistics. Unfortunately most companies I am involved with don't measure these metrics (because hey-ho, what gets measured gets managed and vice versa).

So here are some examples to illustrate how radically different the reality and the business models are for new product development.

##Example 1 - Only 20% of Features are commonly used in a mature product
This is from the poster child report for Agile Development, [This showed](http://www.featuredrivendevelopment.com/node/614) that typically only 20% of features in a product are often or always used. (with 45% being never used, 19% rarely used or 16% sometimes used.) 

Another great story is how the Microsoft Office team [recorded](http://mg.co.za/article/2006-12-11-a-newlook-office-suite) that 80% feature requests were for features already in the product. 

Yet whilst these examples demonstrate the issue with concentrating on efficiently adding features to your product, they don't really help us here.

## Better Example, VC Success rate.
The best example I have seen so far is in Fred Wilson's [AVC blog post](http://avc.com/2016/02/fund-level-vs-deal-by-deal-carry/) where he lists, admittedly hypothetical, expected success rates for a VC fund where
1. 30% of investment are successful and deliver 5x ROI
2. 35% of investments break even, so dont lost money, yet also don't generate any meaningful ROI.
3. 35% of investments generate no ROI.

I think these figures do a great job of challenging the conventional investment / business processes in companies for new products. 

A key step for any big company would be to measure, publish and share the equivalent for their new products.

Working in Mobile I dont think that Fred's hypothetical figures are that pessimistic, This is because I lived through SMS, WAP, 3G, Unified Messaging, Mobile Instant Messaging (WV/OMA and RCS), Direct Carrier Billing, Vodafone 360 and WAC.
