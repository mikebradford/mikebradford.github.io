title: Why B2B products need to be developed as B2C
layout: post
---
I have mainly worked in a B2B environments, often as a vendor supplying services or systems to other companies who would then sell to their customers.

This is the way that the Mobile Ecosystem has predominantly worked for the past 10 years.

This is also the way that the Mobile Ecosystem has tried to develop and deliver new products for the last 10 years.

The companies I work for have also tried to work via partners (not always mobile operators) in order to reach customers as part of the new product development process.

This is done for logical reasons. Partners may have large existing customer bases, sales teams or complementary product sets.

Unfortunately this often fails.

Despite all the reasons why new product development with partners would make sense, there are also other reasons which make it challenging.

New product development requires iteration and discovery. Models are a crucial first step towards validating product demand and needs, but they need validation.

Working in a B2B relationship makes this feedback loop slow.

This is why it makes sense to test new product ideas by selling direct. This may not be scalable, or make sense for your long term business plan, but it enables you to develop the right proposition & product first, before you try and scale it out.
