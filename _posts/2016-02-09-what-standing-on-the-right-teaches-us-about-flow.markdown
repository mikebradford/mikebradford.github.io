title: What Standing on the Right teaches us about Flow

This post is inspired by this Grauniad article [The tube at a standstill: why TfL stopped people walking up the escalators](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/16/the-tube-at-a-standstill-why-tfl-stopped-people-walking-up-the-escalators)

This example provides a great metaphor for product delivery flow and some of the challenges with improving it.

## The Article
This article covers the important subject of standing on the right on the escalators on the Tube.
Ingrained habit and it's merits appear obvious. Enables people in a hurry to get through quicker.

However as load on system increases, LU need to increase the flow in the busiest stations.
They tried an experiment to see if making people stand on both sides increases flow 
Idea inspired by one persons experience in Hong Kong. Idea initially validated using a model.

The experiment validated the idea, and showed greater improvement in flow than predicted using the model (over 25% increase at peak times)

However
1. Customers hate the idea
2. Large amount of effort is required to try and change default behaviour
3. Customers didnt stick to the idea once the experiment was complete
4. Customers dont believe the idea

## As Metaphor for Product Delivery Flow 
1. Some ways to increase Product Delivery Flow will seem counter intuitive, and go against existing practice
2. Expediting some deliveries will reduce overall flow
3.Models and Experiments are an important part of validating ideas
4. Changing Behaviour will be very hard
5. Behaviour is likely to relapse 
6. A better way to seel the change is to describe how it will benefit them personally, and not to pitch the change as asking them to sacrifice for the good of the overall team.
