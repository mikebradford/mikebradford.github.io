title: Culture is not the office table tennis table

A major challenge implementing Agile/Lean, or indeed any change, is making sure that the culture is aligned with the new change.

Culture is important because it underpins strategy, process and tactics. 

As Clayton Christensen put it _"Culture determines how people automatically react"_.

Get your culture right, and people would normally automatically make the 'right' decisions, even in the absence of process or direct managerial involvement.
If your culture is 'wrong' (i.e. mismatched with your process or vision) then people will find it hard to make the 'right' decisions. Even if you change the process and leadership. 

So if your culture doesn't match the new Agile process then the business will struggle to act in an Agile way.

Christensen also points out that people confuse cause, effect and symptoms. 

For example, 
1. A high trust culture means that people are empowered to make decisions and take responsibility meaning that work gets delivered faster so generating more revenue.
2. It also means that you can put a table tennis table in your office because you can trust your employees to only play table tennis when appropriate.
3. However getting a table tennis table doesn't mean you have a high trust culture, or can deliver work faster.

[Edgar Schien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Schein) would describe the Table Tennis table as an 'artefact' of the culture.

Now there is a lot of discussion on the 'soft' parts of culture and how to change it :-) While this is important, and it underlines how story telling, leadership and values are important part of culture, this isn't all of it.

A more concrete, in my eyes, part of culture are the underlying financial rules used in resource allocation and prioritisation.

Unless these are aligned with Agile, then the business will continue to make decisions that are 'not' Agile. and will undermine the change in priorities.

This will more likely happen when Agile is seen as a technology issue or process, which is grafted onto an existing business.

Core, existing business values, particularly in product management and finance, will be oriented about maximising efficiency, instead of effectiveness.

One example is the business case, a key milestone used to review and approve projects, products and releases. 

The business case, and metrics are to plan and approve investment in ideas, projects and products typically includes the following
* Revenue
* Costs (CAPEX and OPEX)
[* NPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) Calculation
* [IRR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return) Calculation

All of these metrics will encourage efficiency over effectiveness. Without predicting risks as a financial metric, then the business processes will not support an Agile culture
