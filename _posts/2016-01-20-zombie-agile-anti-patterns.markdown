title: Agile, Go to Market planning, and Business Cases. A case study
layout: post

I believe that existing/legacy business processes are not aligned with Agile.

To me Agile is about effectiveness and conventional business processes are about efficiency.

## Agile can increase effectiveness and ROI
Agile enables the business to test assumptions, as part of the investment process, enabling investment to be re-allocated depending if this would provide a better rate of return.

A great metaphor of how this works is provided by Reinertsen [here](http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-four-impostors-success-failure-knowledge-creation-and-learning/). As well as criticising the focus on learning, failure it provides a very nice example of how incremental investment can maximise the ROI.

I work in mobile and on a lot of new products, as well as some cash cows. One problem we face is how prioritise development and markets. One common question being do we prioritise roll out a product or feature to large or small mobile markets first.

## Planning, Revenue and Cost.
When I first had to make this call, I prioritised based on revenue. This seems very sensible, especially as it optimises the business case.

We worked with a customer, also Agile, on a project who prioritised based on cost/development resource. Their bottleneck was development, so they targeted markets requiring the least custom development first. 

For the project in question we were both wrong (using 20/20 hindsight). We should have targeted markets that would have allowed us to get quicker feedback, and be able to adapt based on the feedback.

However if I try and share this learning with my peers I get a lot of push back. 

Considering why I see two reasons
* It is counter intuitive on a personal level
* It would worsen the business case financial metrics of [NPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) and [IRR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return)

## SAFE & Weighted Shortest Job First
I recently did SAFE training, and was interested in whether the SAFE endorsed prioritisation method may be better.

## Testing with a worked example

We are launching a new product using Mobile Operator APIs. 
The nature of the market means that we need to be able to sign up sufficient operators in a country to be able to cover most of the mobile subscribers. (lets say 75%).

We have two countries lined up.
