title: Zombie Agile = Anti-Patterns
layout: post
---
A common complaint about Agile Transformations these days is about the prevalence of Zombie or Cargo-Cult implementations.

This is where Agile processes are followed but without delivering agility.

There is a lot of discussion about why this happens, including by me :-).

However a simpler explanation or analogy would be that Zombie Agile is the result of the implementation of [Anti-Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) relating to Agile Processes such as stand ups, sprints, user stories, estimation.

As such I wonder why more effort isn't taken to discuss anti-patterns as part of SCRUM or Agile training?
