title: Agile, Go to Market planning, and Business Cases. A case study
layout: post

I believe that existing/legacy business processes are not aligned with Agile.

To me Agile is about effectiveness and conventional business processes are about efficiency.

## Agile can increase effectiveness and ROI
Agile enables the business to test assumptions, as part of the investment (i.e delivery) process, enabling investment to be re-allocated depending if this would provide a better rate of return.

A great metaphor of how this works is provided by Reinertsen [here](http://reinertsenassociates.com/the-four-impostors-success-failure-knowledge-creation-and-learning/). As well as criticising the mis-leading label of failure it provides a very nice example of how incremental investment can maximise the ROI.

##This is easier in theory than practice.
I work in mobile and on a lot of new products, as well as some cash cows. Everyone is keen to use an Agile product delivery process, but not so keen to change the business processes to match. 

One area this affects is how we prioritise development and markets. The common question being do we prioritise rolling out the product or feature to large or small mobile markets first.

## Prioritisation based on Revenue and Cost.
When I first had to make this call, I prioritised based on revenue. This seems very sensible, especially as it optimises the business case.

We worked with a customer, also Agile, on a project who prioritised based on cost/development resource. Their bottleneck was development, so they targeted markets requiring the least custom development first. 

For the project in question we were both wrong (using 20/20 hindsight). We should have targeted markets that would have allowed us to get quicker feedback, and be able to adapt based on the feedback.

However if I try and share this learning with my peers I get a lot of push back. 

Considering why I see two reasons
* Not only is it counter intuitive on a personal level
* It would also worsen the business case financial metrics of [NPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) and [IRR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return)

## Alternatives

Two agile alternatives are [Cost of Delay](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/) and [WSJF](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/) 

Cost of Delay is interesting, because it factors in the missed revenue and how long it takes to deliver. This often provides a more compelling case to deliver quicker, even if it costs more, or if it delivers less revenue in the long term. (As an aside it also demonstrates the economic benefit of increased flow efficiency, even if resource costs increase) 

WSJF is the prioritisation method in SaFE. At it's core it is based on Cost of Delay, but includes some additional factors, such estimates of whether the feature is _Time Critical_ or _Reduces Risk or Enables Opportunity_.

I was curious if these methods would be useful to demonstrate the financial benefits of prioritising in an Agile fashion.

# A Case Study based on a real example

We are launching a new product using Mobile Operator APIs. 
The nature of the market means that we need to be able to sign up sufficient operators in a country to be able to cover most of the mobile subscribers. (lets say 75%).

We have two countries lined up.
Red has a market which is
