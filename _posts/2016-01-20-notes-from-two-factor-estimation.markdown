title: Notes from Two Factor Estimation
layout: post
---
O'Reilly Webcast is [here](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3592).

Two factor Estimating means _Estimate Value as well as Size_.

Estimate the size of each story in the usual agile way using Story Points, Relative Estimating, Fibonacci sizing etc.

Also estimate Value points for each story representing the value of each story.
These are estimated by Customer representative (i.e. Product Owner). 
Use the same rules and techniques as story points. Such as Relative estimation, Fibonacci. sizing.

Then calculate the _Bang for Buck_ for each story by dividing the value point estimate by the story point estimate.

Use the _Bang for Buck_ as the initial method to prioritise stories in order to help to deliver most bang for buck early.

## My opinion
1. Webcast gives great overview of Story point estimation
2. Value points are very interesting, since they shift the conversation from how much effort work will take, to what value is delivered. 
This fits with my personal obsession of __effectiveness over efficiency__
