I used to follow Rands in Repose when I used Twitter. Now I found out it was an alter ego for a guy called Michael Lopp.

Now Michael Lopp did a [Talk](https://player.oreilly.com/videos/9781491937204) at Cultivate.

It dealt with the basics (foundation habits in [Gretchen Rubin speak](https://gretchenrubin.com/books/before-after/before-after/) ) of management.

This was amusingly sub-titled the Vegetable Talk as in, you know you need to eat your vegetables but rarely do.

The talk covers 6 Management Vegetables

## Potato
Your job is to gather, abstract, filter and delver information. You should expect to repeat yourself a lot!
The most important tool for this is the _1:1_ which should be done for at least 30mins every week.

## Corn
You underestimate the cost of saying nothing. 
Michael describes the parable of Jeff, the typical high performing employee who is bit of a jerk. 
However the situation never seems bad enough to warrant you doing something about it.
The most important thing to remember is that _Everyone is Replaceable_.

## Broccoli
You probably hire people like you. This reduces diversity.
The most important thing you can do is to _be an advocate & ally for diversity_.

## Tomato
You set the tone & cadence all the time. 
Michael describes the parable of his kids.
The most important thing you can do is to model the right behaviours all the time, i,e. starting and finishing meetings on time.

## Carrot
You are bad at somethings.
The most important thing you can do is to _delegate_. Not just what you are bad at, but also what you are good at. Use delegation to develop other people.

## What you should Do!
From the above, as a leader you should prioritise
1. Holding Regular 1:1
2. Delegate work
3. Build & communicate a strategy

## Bonus Point.
The parable of DJ. The best leader Michael has ever seen is DJ who he plays an online game with. 
DJ is _unfailingly kind_.
