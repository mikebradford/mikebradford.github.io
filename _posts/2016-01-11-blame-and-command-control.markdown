Just finished reading Beyond Blame.

Really good read.

One thing I got from it is how Blame can creep up on you.

Such as Accountability can be micontrued as blame (need to fall on your sword) as opposed to being honest enough to be open about what happened.

It also pointed out how Blame is very seductive and misinformed in the world of complex systems. A point also raised in Matthew Syed's book, Black Box thinking.  

By synchronicity also also watched a talk by Rene Brown on Blame, which had an a very pertinent additional point.

She points out how blame is often used to compensate for a lack of control. The desire to assign accountability is driven in cases where you are responsible for somehting but are dependent on others to make somehting happen. 

Blame makes you feel like you can fix things and create a simple anwer.
Even when you know this isnt strictly true the desire to ensure a coulture of accountability is the siren call to still assign blame.
