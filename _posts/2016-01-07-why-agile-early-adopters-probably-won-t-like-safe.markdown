title: Why Agile Early Adopters probably won't like SAFe
layout: post

Now Agile is hitting the mainstream there is a lot of talk about Agile Transformation, and often about SAFe.

My current company is implementing Agile transformation, and I have recently done SAFe course.

I found the SAFe course very interesting and comprehensive, covering a lot of agile concepts as well as processes, but I did struggle with a number of parts of it.

Now I deliberately want to avoid an Agile ideology discussion. These are very common (for example they used to be about language, i.e. C vs Java vs PHP vs Erlang etc) and often miss the point. In most cases I believe these 'ideology' discussions are a result of the human condition.

I truly believe the proof of anything is in whether it works, not the sanctity or purity of the model.
I also believe different models may be appropriate for different environments / cultures. 

For example 
David Anderson mapped some different Agile/Lean models against Societal values (see slide 17 http://www.slideshare.net/agilemanager/social-engineering-with-in-for-kanban-55077013)
or look at how the Cynefin model shows that while a process heavy approach (such as SAFe) is more appropriate to Complicated environments, whilst more experimental models, such as Lean Kanban, are a better fit for Complex environments.

I then started thinking about SAFe in the context of adoption curve, and that it seems to me expressly designed for Enterprise Adoption. 

This led me to think that it would be natural for SAFe to not appeal to the existing Agile community, since this community will currently mainly be composed of early adopters.

Early Agile Adoption tended to be
- experimental
- valued outcome over process
- bottom up approach
- willing to work counter the established Enterprise best practice

Of course there could also be an element of 'I was into Agile before it was cool'  :-)
