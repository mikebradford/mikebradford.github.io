title: Why Agile Early Adopters probably won't like SAFe
layout: post
---
Now Agile is hitting the mainstream there is a lot of talk about Agile Transformation, and often about SAFe.

My current company is implementing Agile transformation, and have recently done SAFe course.

I found SAFe course very interesting and comprehensive, but I struggled with a number of parts of it.

Want to avoid ideology discussion. Very common (used to be C vs Java vs Erlang ....) and often misses the point. In most cases these are a result of the human condition.

I believe the proof of anything is in whether it works, not the sanctity or purity of the model.
I also believe different models may be appropriate for different environments / cultures
- reference anderson slide on cultural fit
- reference cynefin for experimental vs process.

I started thinking of SAFe in the context of adoption curve, and that it seems to me expressly designed for Enterprise Adoption. This led me to think that it would be natural for SAFe to not appeal to the existing Agile community, which is mainly composed of early adopters.

My experience
- worked in Agile workplaces (without realising it)
- Agile (SCRUM) implementation with outsourced team - mixed success IMO
- contact with other Agile teams across organisation. - some very successful, some less so.
- Keen interest (books, meetups etc).

Early Agile Adoption
- experimental
- valued outcomes over process
- typically bottom up
- counter to 'Enterprise' best practice
