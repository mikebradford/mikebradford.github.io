title: Effectiveness vs. Efficiency. An Open Water Swimming Example
layout: post
---
I like Open Water Swimming and one of my goals this year is to do more open water races, and increase the distances I do.

Part of my training for this is to do more regular pool swimming sessions, and work at improving my swimming fitness and stroke technique. All of which should improve my swimming efficiency.

However I recently watched a video which neatly demonstrated the importance of effectiveness.

The Swim Smooth video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N42wl2IzPQo) demonstrates the importance of sighting to check direction in open water swimming. 

Without these direction checks to ensure that you are travelling in the right direction then swimmers tend to go off course, zig-zagging along. This means that even if they swim faster, they swim much farther.

This shows why swimming effectively can be more important than swimming efficiently. Emphasising the importance of good technique, and concentrating on direction, rather than just swimming fast.
