Talk was presented at the [London Scrum User Group](http://www.meetup.com/London-Scrum-User-Group/) and was by [Ken Rubin](http://www.innolution.com/).

Thanks to the guys at Skills Matter a video and slides are available [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7382-beyond-agile-pilot-stage-time-to-embrace-agile-budgeting-planning-and-cost-accounting).

Very interesting topic with useful information. Some we had previously worked out on our own, including how to account for and capitalise development in an Agile environment, using Story Points.

I liked the illustration how most of annual budgetting is theatre.
