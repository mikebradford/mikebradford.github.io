Talk was presented at the [London Scrum User Group](http://www.meetup.com/London-Scrum-User-Group/) and was by [Ken Rubin](http://www.innolution.com/).

Thanks to the guys at Skills Matter a video and slides are available [here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/7382-beyond-agile-pilot-stage-time-to-embrace-agile-budgeting-planning-and-cost-accounting).

Very interesting topic with useful information. Some we had previously worked out on our own, including how to account for and capitalise development in an Agile environment, using Story Points.

I liked the illustration how most of annual budgetting is theatre. Underlying the typical process, of roadmaps, estimates, forecasts etc. what actually happens is 
1. Sales Forecast is used to predict revenue for year
2. Decision on how much profit is required and what % can be spent on R&D
3. This dictates budget for Development
4. Negotiation then happens on what can be delivered for the budget.

There was an interesting discussion of Capitalisation & Agile. Particularly on how capitalisation rules are based on waterfall development model. If you expense all agile development, since it doesnt appear to map to the rules, then agile is seen as more expensive. Thus disincentivising agile. One example mentioned was a company providing only 50% of resource to Agile since it is too expensive.

Another point which has started me thinking is about Resource as most visible cost, which is why it gets managed most actively. In my mind linked to how organisation culture undermines Agile.
If you implement Agile but dont change the costs you measure and manage then you will undermine Agile and probably  not see any of the potential benefits.

Lastly, a question towards the end has inspired a new topic to investigate [throughput accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput_accounting).
