title: Agile is not Free .....

My father was a computer engineer for ICL, back in the days when computers were large and used big banks of tapes.

One day, back in the '80s, he brought home a book called 'Quality is Free'. For some reason the title of this book stuck in my teenage head (though I never did read it).

Years later I read that the book's title had a major unintended consequence which undermined it's  message.

The premise of the book is that whilst it does take time and money to improve quality it is a sound investment, since the financial benefits of improved quality more than cover the cost.

However I read a lot of business leaders took the book title at face value. 

As a result they believed that Quality could be improved with little or no investment, or impact on the way the company currently did business.

The expectation was that the 'workforce' could improve Quality at no cost, in addition to the work that was already performed.

Unfortunately nothing in life worth having is free. Quality is worthwhile but you need to invest time, money and effort to deliver it.

'Agile' is the same. It is worthwhile but it requires investment, and not just in training, consultants and table tennis tables.

It requires businesses to 'invest' in a new set of KPIs and culture based around effectiveness and not efficiency.

This is hard (harder than just implementing a new process) and requires commitment. 

It also requires us to work against inbuilt organisational and cognitive biases. More on these biases will follow in a later post.
