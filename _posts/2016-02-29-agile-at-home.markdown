title: Agile at Home
layout: post
---
My wife and I use Agile to survive and thrive at home.

We have 4 lovely and lively children between 5 and 11 years old, and we both have busy jobs in Tech.

We have adapted Agile to help us keep our lives organised, but also to help us focus on what is important, including how we adapt and re-prioritise as our children grow and develop.

This is how we do it now.

## Tools and Artefacts

We started with a lot more physical items such as a family diary and a planning wall using post-its.

This was great to start with, particularly is it really involved the children. However it was hard getting these to scale, plus also limited our options when we weren't both at home.

We have made the shift to doing everything online. Google Drive and Trello make this very easy.

### Tools

1. Google Calendar - share our calendars, including children.

2. Sunrise, I access Google Calendar through Sunrise, since it means I can have Trello Tasks and Appointments all in one place. However Sunrise will be shutting down soon :-(

3. Trello - track all the work! I use this for work and personal boards, as well as family ones.

4. Google Slides - mainly used for the 'The Family playbook' (see below)

5. Google Sheets - used for Budgets, Christmas shopping lists etc

6. Google Drive - used as shared document archive (including Scans)

7. Google docs - i.e. templates for letters to school

8. Google Hangouts - for meeting virtually when we're in different places.

### Artefacts

1. The Family Playbook
This captures our family objectives in a 7 slide document. Created based on [this book](http://www.tablegroup.com/books/frantic) by Patrick Lencioni. Once a quarter we review and create defining (i.e. strategic) objectives for the family, based on what is most important for the next 3 months. This includes things like school applications, exams, goals etc.

2. Actions Board (Trello)
This captures all our ongoing actions, categorised into the following columns-  Today, This Week, Next Week, New, Waiting/Blocked and Done.

3. Backlog / Upcoming Board (Trello). 
This is Informed by the [GTD forward file](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Tickler_file), It includes upcoming stuff we need to do, organised into monthly columns.

4. Budget. 
Spreadsheets tracking our monthly budget (for recurring expenses) and cashflow plan for upcoming projects (such as house renovations)

5. Templates.
For everything from absence letters (for when the children are off school sick) to thank you letters.

## Rituals

We have two meetings a week to review.

1. Face to face at the weekend 

2 At lunchtime during the week over Google Hangouts.

We originally had one F2F meeting but found that the meeting needed ~2 hours and became an energy suck. Splitting it down made it a lot easier to do.

During the meeting we cycle through 3 main items

1. Calendar review.
Where we sync on the next 2 weeks, such as whose where, doing pick up etc, as well any extra stuff such as birthday parties, work trips etc.

2. Trello Board Review. 
Where we review the active board, including progress on existing actions, as well as mining and tri-aging new actions.

3. Family Playbook review.  
We review the defining and standard objectives, giving them a RYG score and identifying the next step on each one.
