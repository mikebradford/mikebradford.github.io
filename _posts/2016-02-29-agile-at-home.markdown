title: Agile at Home
layout: post
---
My wife and I use Agile to survive and thrive at home.

We have 4 lovely and lively children between 5 and 11 years old, and we both have busy jobs in Tech.

We have adapted Agile to help us keep our lives organised, but also to help us focus on what is important, including how we adapt and re-prioritise as our children grow and develop.

This is how we do it now.

## Tools and Artefacts
We use the following tools and artefacts. 

We started with a lot more physical items such as a family diary and a planning wall using post-its.

This was great to start with, particularly is it really involved the children. However it was hard getting these to scale, plus also limited our options when we weren't both at home.

We have made the shift to doing everything online. Google Drive and Trello make this very easy.

### Tools
1. Google Calendar - share our calendars, including children.
2. Sunrise, I access Google Calendar through Sunrise, since it means I can have Trello Tasks and Appointments all in one place. However Sunrise will be shutting down soon :-(
2. Trello - track all the work! I use this for work and personal boards, as well as family ones.
3. Google Slides - The Family playbook
4. Google Sheets - Budgets, Christmas shopping lists etc
5. Google Drive - shared document archive (including Scans)
6. Google docs - i.e. templates for letters to school
3. Google Hangouts - 

### Artefacts
1. The Family Playbook
2. Actions Board (Trello)
3. Backlog / Upcoming Board (Trello)
4. Budget
5. Templates

## Rituals
We have two meetings a week to review.
One Face to face at the weekend and one over Google Hangouts, at lunchtime during the week.
We cycle through 3 main items
1. Calendar review
2. Trello Board Review
3. Family Playbook
