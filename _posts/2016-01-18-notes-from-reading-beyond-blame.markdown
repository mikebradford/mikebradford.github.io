Learning Review Framework

** Context
1) Purpose is to learn so we can improve. No blame, shame, demotion, firing or punishment. Going beyond blame is the only way to ensure all the information is always shared

2) we're likely working within complex systems, and cannot apply simlistic linear cause and effect models to investigate trouble within such systems

3) Failure is a normal part of the functioning of complex systems. All systems fail, it is just a question of time

4) we seek to not only understand the few things that go wrong, but also the many things that go right iin order to make resilient systems.

5) the root cause for both function and malfunction in complex systems is change.

6) Humar error is a symptom, never the cause. As Demmings said it is the systems fault, not the person. We reject he few bad apples theory (see zimbardo) Seek to understand why it made sense for people to do what they did.

7) Be aware of cognitive biases as they can impact the review.

** Build a timeline

1) what happened from the perspective of the individuals
2) describe what happened, dont explain
3) the more diverse points of view you collect the fuller the picture of the incident
4) facilitator needs to discover and verify by synthesising

** Determine and prioritise remediation items. This can be done seperately from the timeline.

** Publish the Learning Review as widely as possible.
If people are impacted then use the 3 Rs (Regret, Reason, Remedy) to structure

** Look for Biases including
1) Language Could have, should have, if only, we didnt
2) Ask questions
- did we know at the time or is it only obvious in hindsight
- when did we learn this fact
- how does knowing the outcome change our perception
- this this a likely explanation because we've recently had a similar problem, and how is this different.
- Describe what happened without explaining (too much)
- Any of us whould have done the same. Lets focus on how it made sense at the time and what we can do better in the future
- Does it sound like a counterfactual
- how do we know this
