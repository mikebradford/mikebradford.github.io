title: Agile Fails Because Businesses measure the wrong things
layout: post

"What gets measured, gets managed", is a well known quote by [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker).

This quote also helps explain why Businesses miss out on the benefits of Agile.

Agile is a tool which enables businesses to be more effective, particularly when delivering new products.

This is because it targets thoses costs which are largest for on new products.

By default businesses track the most obvious and visible cost, which is resource (for IT work anyway).

This causes the Finance team to predominantly track resource costs, and spend against forecasts.
These are all sensible to do when your biggest cost is the resource.

However there are 2 other Costs which are significantly greater than the cost of the resource
1) Cost of Failure
2) Cost of Delay

Cost of Failure is when a product/project/investment is completed but doesnt return the expected revenue.
This is a common, (i.e. more than 50%) occurence with new products. 
This cost is reduced by identifying key assumptions, dependencies and risks and building your product in a way that addresses these risks early on.

Cost of Delay is the lost revenue when it takes a long time to deliver a new feature/product/initiative. This  cost often far outweighs the cost of introducing idle time into the resource chain to deliver earlier.

Now if you introduce Agile, most businesses dont change what they measure.

They have no measure of the Cost of Failure, or Cost of Delay in their business. 

This means
1. They see no benefits from Agile on their financial metrics (if anything they get worse)
2. they take no measures to manage the business processes to reduce the Cost of Failure or Cost of Delay.
