title: How' Agile Works

The biggest selling points of Agile (often touted as the **'Why'**) are
1) Increased Productivity
2) Reduced Time To Market
3) Increased Responsiveness

Of course any Enterprise is going to want these :-) 

Unfortunately the expectation set is that an Agile process (such as SCRUM) is implemented and then the team soon starts shipping 50% more work in half the time.

However this doesn't take into account **'How'** Agile works, and not only sets unrealistic 

Agile increases Productivity not by increasing efficiency, such as code written, releases shipped etc. but by making the team more effective.

It does this in three main ways

## 1) Deliver Work Quicker 
typically by increasing the flow efficiency by 
a) reducing the workload (Littles law)
b) increasing the labour pool liquidity (reducing hand offs between teams)
c) moving to a self service model (i.e. Operations enable developers to deploy in a controlled fashion, as opposed to acting as a control point)
(a) and (b) actually reduce the worker efficiency!

## 2) Cancel Work Earlier
Many initiatives, projects or features don't deliver the expected business value making them a major source of waste. Agile techniques can enable the business to evaluate the initiative early, meaning that the initiative or project can be changed or cancelled based on real market feedback.
This is as opposed to more traditional approaches where fewer projects are initiated but are only cancelled once the full solution is delivered.

## 3) Reduce Waste 
Agile techniques don't actually reduce wast but help make visible the sources of waste. These are not necessarily obvious from the top down, due to the complexity of the systems involved. A number of case studies have shown major sources of waste to be business controls put in place (such as detailed estimation and cost allocation as shown in the Kanban Blue Book)

The key point being that 'Less Work is done, it is just the Right Work'.

Now you can implement Agile processes such as SCRUM, two week sprints, retrospectives, however if you don't increase Flow Efficiency, Structure Roadmaps so you can evaluate and cancel projects early, and target waste reduction then you will not increase Productivity.
