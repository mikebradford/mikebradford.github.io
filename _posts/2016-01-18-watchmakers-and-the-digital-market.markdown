I read an interesting article last week over on Medium [What Can a Stupid, Mansplaining Comment Teach You About Neoliberalism?](https://medium.com/@girlziplocked/what-can-a-stupid-mansplaining-comment-teach-you-about-neoliberalism-9d7e13f62dd#.cxu9tfhsq) which, as part of an __epic__ rant, poked holes in the market driven approach increasingly driving innovation.

I have a lot of sympathy with this, and how the grand, hard tech projects of the past seem to have been displaced. Unlike the predictions of the SciFi greats such as Robert Heinlein, Julian May or Isaac Asimov there are no daily rocket services to the southern hemisphere, colonies on Mars or the Moon, or cheap fusion energy. 

My technology career too has evolved from building supersonic aircraft to making it easier for people to buy Apps on their mobile phone. I have seen my peers to move from modelling the electro-magnetics of lightning strikes to financial quants. 

Some would argue that this is Elon Musk has turned to trying to solve, with SpaceX and the Hyperloop. Others might argue that we have solved more important problems which have benefited more people, such as avoiding mass starvation and connecting Billions via the Mobile Internet.

However another SciFi reference that sprung to mind, was that of the Watchmakers in ['The Mote in God's Eye'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mote_in_God%27s_Eye) .

They use their instinctual technology skills on __anything__, no matter how inane. Resulting in them customising toothbrush handles as well as improving core parts of the spaceships technology.

Is that where we are now?
