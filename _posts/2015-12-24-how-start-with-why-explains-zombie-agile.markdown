title: Avoid 'Zombie Agile' by understanding 'How' Agile works
layout: post
---
As Agile becomes mainstream and is now being merrily adopted by ‘the Enterprise’ it is being increasingly recognised that many adoptions suffer from ‘Zombie Scrum’ or Cargo Cult syndrome.

Enterprise Implementations follow many Agile processes but without any of the expected benefits.

This ties in with what Simon Sinek describes in his famous Ted talk [Start with Why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)

Simon talks about the Golden Circle and the importance of explaining why, moving through how before you get to what.

In my eyes Agile the process is the **‘What’**, and any Agile transformation that concentrates on adherence to the process, risks becoming a cargo cult implementation.

Yet many Agile transformations do actually talk about the **'Why'**. They talk about the importance of the Agility and the increased productivity that can be achieved.

However they never, as far as I can tell, talk about the **'How'**. They go straight from the **'Why'** (increased Agility and productivity) to the **'What'** (Processes).

Now the **'How'** is important because it informs what needs to change in the Culture, especially the changes in Enterprise priorities, behaviours and KPIs required for Agile to succeed.

My view and opinions on the **'How'** is what I will dive into in future posts.
