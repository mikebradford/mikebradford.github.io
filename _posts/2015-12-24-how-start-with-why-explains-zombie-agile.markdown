title: How 'Start with Why' explains 'Zombie Agile'
layout: post

As Agile becomes mainstream and is now being merrily adopted by ‘the Enterprise’ it is being increasingly recognised that many adoptions suffer from ‘Zombie Scrum’ or Cargo Cult syndrome.

The follow many Agile processes but without any of the expected benefits.

This ties in with what Simon Sinek describes in his famous Ted talk [Start with Why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en)

Simon talks about the Golden Circle and the importance of explaining why, moving through how before you get to what. You need to understand

For Agile the process is the ‘What’, and any Agile transformation that concentrates on adherence to the process, risks becoming a cargo cult implementation.

Many Agile transformations do actually talk about the Why. They talk about the importance of the Agility and the increased productivity that can be achieved.

However they never, as far as I can tell, talk about the how. They go straight from the Why (increased Agility and productivity) to the What (Processes).

Now the How is important because it informs what needs to change in the Culture, especially the changes in Enterprise priorities, behaviours and KPIs required for Agile to succeed.

My view and opinions on the How is what I will dive into in future posts.
