## Absolute Estimation Sucks.

Our brains aren't designed for it resulting in all sorts of cognitive biases such as [Optimism Bias & Planning Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias#Policy.2C_planning.2C_and_management). Their impact on project planning, timescale estimation and predicting project success are explored by Daniel Kahneman in [Thinking Fast and Slow]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow).

This means that estimation errors aren't randomly distributed around the true value (for example a normal distribution with the true value as the mean) but are systematically wrong.

The British Government has even compiled a [report](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/191507/Optimism_bias.pdf) showing how it effects public projects. This even includes suggested values to compensate for Optimism Bias.

## Relative Estimation can be more accurate

Kahneman talks about how relative estimation is one way of avoiding these biases.

A practical example used in the [two factor estimation webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3592) is the time it took to build two bridges, the brooklyn and covington-cincinnati bridges. It is hard to estimate the time it took from first principles, but easier to estimate the other when one is known, based on their relative length and complexity.

This is the foundation of agile estimation using story points.

## This is counter to __Legacy__ Estimation best practice 

Relative Estimation, particularly using macro-estimates (i.e. length of bridge instead of number of tasks, people, or time worked) is hard for business to accept since it runs counter to the __legacy way of estimating of 
- breaking down the the project into work to be done to the smallest possible level of detail
- estimating each task
- adding it all back together again.

This approach feels wrong due to another bias, [precision bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_bias) , where we assume precise estimates and figures are more accurate. This is why every _experienced_ product, finance and sales manager provide forecasts to 2 decimal places. It shows you that a formula has been used, as opposed to 'Wild Ass Guesses'.

## Why Story Points?

Story points are designed to help promote the following
- Relative estimation, since they aren't based on how long you think it will take you to do something
- Avoid conflating time spent with work done, another common mistake. 
- Avoiding precision to acknowledge they are estimates.

The last point is also why it is often recommended to use the Fibonacci sequence.

TO ADD

## The use of feedback loops to improve estimates


## Story Point Anti-Patterns
- resize based on time worked
- estimate from first principles and convert between time worked and story points (can be impossible to do when man/days are used to estimate the team velocity)
-- dont track statistics 
- dont use as feedback for velocity
- use decimal places in estimates.

## Two factor Estimating

### Estimate Value as well as Size

Value points for each story, estimated by Customer representative (i.e. Product Owner). 
Same rules as story points. Relative, Fibonacci.

### Calculate Bang for Buck for each story, use to prioritise stories to deliver most bang for buck early
