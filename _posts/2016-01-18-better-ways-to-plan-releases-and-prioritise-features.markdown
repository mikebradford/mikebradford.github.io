title: Better ways to plan releases and prioritise features?
layout: post
---
You don't get the full benefit of Agile or Lean Delivery if you don't update your _release planning_ method.

By _release planning_ I mean how the business, as represented by Product Management, plan how features and products are built and delivered to the market. i.e. 
* which markets are you going to launch first. 
* whether you are going to do a staged delivery. 
* whether you build the complete product vs a limited release that test the market first.

Agile and Lean work by prioritising Effectiveness over Efficiency. The simpler, more common release scheduling methods, such as prioritising based on the Revenue opportunity, or minimising Cost do not encourage this.

Also the release scheduling methods best suited for prioritising enhancements to proven and mature products are not always suitable for the scheduling of releases and go to market for new products.

This is yet another example of where large enterprises applying their proven best practice to new products leads to sub-optimal decisions. Or phrased another way, how an enterprise culture undermines agile values.

Here lets look at and compare the different options.

## Revenue
This is the most common method, since it seems to make sense, and can work well for proven mature products.

In these cases it makes sense to roll out features which are forecast to generate the most revenue first, 

This approach also fits very well with the typical Business Case process which prioritises maximum revenue for least cost for a proposed solution. It also appeals to the Sales team for a similar reason :-)

## Cost
This approach is also common, at it is also fits well with the typical Business Case process. 

This typically results in the work being prioritised to deliver the 'complete' solution in a single release. This is also particularly common where development resource is scarce or a blame culture means that development are afraid of being accused of delivering an incomplete solution that doesn't scale/support multiple customers/misses features.  

## Cost of Delay
This is slightly more sophisticated than Revenue and/or Cost, and is the preferred method for [Reinertson](http://leanmagazine.net/lean/cost-of-delay-don-reinertsen/) and the [Black Swan Farming Team](http://blackswanfarming.com/cost-of-delay/).

Unlike the previous methods this technique can justify 
* spending more to get a product launched quicker
* encourages delivery of features either individually or in smaller more frequent releases (also happily reducing WIP).

However it doesn't necessarily promote the delivery of limited take into account uncertainty or risk associated with projected revenue.
