title: Better ways to plan releases and prioritise features?
layout: post

You don't get the full benefit of Agile or Lean Delivery if you don't update your release planning method.

By release planning I mean how the business, as represented by Product Management, plan how features and products are delivered to the market. i.e. which markets are you going to launch first. whether you are going to do a staged delivery. whether you build the complete product vs a limited release that test the market first.

Agile and Lean work by prioritising Effectiveness over Efficiency. The simpler, more common release scheduling methods, such as prioritising based on the Revenue opportunity, or minimising Cost do not encourage this.

Also the release scheduling methods best suited for prioritisng enhancements to proven and mature products are not always suitable for the scheduling of releases and go to market for new products.

This is yet another way where large enterprises applying their proven best practice to new products leads to in-effective decision making.

Here lets look at and compare the different options.

## Revenue
This is the most common method, since it seems to make sense, and can work well for proven mature products.

In these cases it makes sense to roll out features which are forecast to generate the most revenue first, 

This approach is also driven by the typical Business Case process which prioiritises maximum revenue for least cost for a proposed solution. It also appeals to the Sales team for a similar reason :-)

## Cost
This approach also 

## Cost of Delay
This is slightly more sophisticated than Revenue and/or Cost.

Can justify spending more to get a product launched quicker.

Can also justify delivering/scheduling features which generate less Revenue earlier, if they can deliver the revenue earlier.
